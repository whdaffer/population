  Again, another awful format which needs lots of cleanup.

   this is the ungainly column names of

  colnames(data)
  [1] "FIPStxt"                         "State"                          
  [3] "Area name"                       "Rural-urban continuum code 2013"

#+END_SRC

Where 'State' is the two letter postal code, 'Area Name' is either the
state repeated (signifying that it's a total) or the country with the
word 'County' appended (like we couldn't fucking figure that one out);
the 'Attribute' is the string 'Population YYYY' (instead of just
having a column named 'Year') and 'Value' which is just the population
(so, naming the column 'population' was too much of a stretch)
